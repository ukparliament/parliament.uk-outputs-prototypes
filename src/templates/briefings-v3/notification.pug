        h2#as1 Overview
        p
          | Gibraltar is the only part of the UK in mainland Europe. It voted to remain in 2016's EU referendum. What is its current status and what discussions are being held about its future?
        p
          | Gibraltar's population is 32,194. It borders Spain and is self-governing within the UK and the EU. Its current chief minister is Fabian Picardo. The Queen is the head of state and the UK is responsible for defence, foreign relations and internal security.
        p
          | 12,000 people cross from Spain every day and 95% of goods entering Gibraltar are from Spain.

        h3 Disputed status
        p
          | The UN Special Committee for Decolonisation listed Gibraltar as a 'Non-Self-Governing Territory' in 1946 that should be subject to 'decolonisation'.
        p
          | Gibraltar disputes this definition.
          sup #[+link('/templates/briefings-v3/reference.html#fn1', '[1]')]
        p
          | Spanish Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, has described Gibraltar as an 'anachronism'.
          sup #[+link('/templates/briefings-v3/reference.html#fn2', '[2]')]

        h3 Shared Sovereignty
        p
          | In 2002 the Spanish and UK governments agreed shared sovereignty.
          sup #[+link('/templates/briefings-v3/reference.html#fn3', '[3]')]
          |  99% of Gibraltarians rejected this in a referendum in 2003. Since then the UK has stated it will not enter into discussions on shared sovereignty without Gibraltar's consent.

        h3 Border controls
        p
          | In 2013 Spain closed its shared border causing long queues.
        p
          | Although EU ruled the controls legal, Gibraltar and the UK rejected the decision.
          sup #[+link('/templates/briefings-v3/reference.html#fn4', '[4]')]

        h3 Hard Brexit
        p
          | Chief minister Picardo was initially concerned about the damage a hard Brexit would cause to Gibraltar's economy. The fact that 90% of its financial sales, insurance and online gaming services are with the UK, however, reassures Mr Picardo that Gibraltar can make a success of Brexit.
          sup #[+link('/templates/briefings-v3/reference.html#fn5', '[5]')]

        h3 Brexit and sovereignty
        p
          | Brexit has resurfaced the issue of sovereignty. Spain sees it as a "unique opportunity".
          sup #[+link('/templates/briefings-v3/reference.html#fn6', '[6]')]
          |  Gibraltar dismisses this as a "fantasy".
          sup #[+link('/templates/briefings-v3/reference.html#fn7', '[7]')]
        p
          | In response, the UK government reiterated its commitment to not discuss sovereignty without Gibraltar's consent.
          sup #[+link('/templates/briefings-v3/reference.html#fn8', '[8]')]
        p
          | The Spanish government has since modified its stance. Spanish foreign minister, Alfonso Dastis, states that it will not put Gibraltar at the centre of negotiations.
          sup #[+link('/templates/briefings-v3/reference.html#fn9', '[9]')]

        h3 Brexit negotiation guidelines
        p
          | Paragraph 22 of the European Council's draft Brexit negotiation guidelines, 31 March 2017 states:
        p
          | After the United Kingdom leaves the Union, no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom.
          sup #[+link('/templates/briefings-v3/reference.html#fn10', '[10]')]
        p
          | The government of Gibraltar feels this is singling it out for special treatment in which Spain can veto any decision.
          sup #[+link('/templates/briefings-v3/reference.html#fn11', '[11]')]
        p
          | Some in the UK government agree with this view.
          sup #[+link('/templates/briefings-v3/reference.html#fn12', '[12]')]
        p
          | Spain, however, sees there is no reason for the UK to "lose its nerve".
          sup #[+link('/templates/briefings-v3/reference.html#fn13', '[13]')]
        p
          | Its inclusion shows EU loyalty to Spain. A view not denied by the EU itself. According to one senior EU official, "the Union will stick up for its members, and that means Spain now."
          sup #[+link('/templates/briefings-v3/reference.html#fn14', '[14]')]

        h2#as2 Background

        h3 Location and population
        ul
         li Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory in the south of the Iberian Peninsula
         li In 2012 it had a population of 32,194
         li Most Gibraltarians are bilingual in English and Spanish
         li They have full British citizenship under the British Nationality Act 1981

        h3 Hand over to Britain 1713
        ul
          li Gibraltar was part of the unified Spanish monarchy from 1462 until 1713
          li Britain was given "the full and entire propriety of the town and castle of Gibraltar [...] forever, without exception or impediment whatsoever" in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 after the War of Spanish Succession

        h3 Status within the UK and EU
        ul
          li It is not a member of the Commonwealth although it was granted Associate Membership of the Commonwealth Foundation in 2014
          li It is part of the EU, though not part of the customs union or common agricultural policy

        h3 Government
        ul
          li Gibraltar has almost complete self-governance through a Parliament of 17 elected members and a Speaker
          li The UK is responsible for defence, foreign relations and internal security
          li The Queen is head of state
          li The current chief minister, leader of the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party (GSLP) Fabian Picardo, was elected in 2015
          li Picardo leads a coalition government with the Gibraltar Liberal Party (GLP)

        h3 Economy
        ul
          li Gibraltar's GDP was forecast to be Â£1.77bn in 2015/1016
          li Its main industries are tourism, financial services, online gaming and construction
          li About 12,000 people cross from Spain to work in Gibraltar every day
          li 95% of goods that enter Gibraltar are from Spain

        h2#as3 Current status

        h3 UN Status
        p
          | Gibraltar's status is disputed. It was listed on the United Nations Special Committee for Decolonization's register of Non-Self-Governing Territories in 1946. According to this definition it should be subject to 'decolonisation' processes.
        p
          | The government of Gibraltar has made the case that it is not a colony. In 2009 former Chief Minister Peter Caruana told the Committee that "Gibraltar is a democratically advanced, modern, economically independent and prosperous, and politically, administratively and legislatively self-governing country".
        p
          | Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, however, has described Gibraltar as an 'anachronism'. Using the Committee's definition of a Non-Self-Governing Territory he has restated Spain's claim to the territory. He has stated that it is the "only such territory in Europe, and one that affects our territorial integrity", and that the UK had "ignored the mandate" of the UN.

        h3 Shared Sovereignty
        p
          | In 2001 former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw started discussions with Spain. This led both countries agreeing principles including "that Britain and Spain should share sovereignty over Gibraltar" in 2002.
        p
          | In a referendum later that year 99% of Gibraltarians rejected the proposal of shared sovereignty. Since then successive UK governments have stated they will never enter into sovereignty discussions or agreements without the consent of the Government of Gibraltar and its people.

        h3 Border controls
        p
          | In 2013 the Spanish government imposed controls on its border with Gibraltar resulting in long queues to cross. This was in response to Gibraltar's construction of an artificial reef in disputed waters used by Spanish fishing boats. Although the European Commission ruled the border checks legal, its decision was rejected by the UK and Gibraltar.
        p
          | A House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee report concluded that, "Spain's measures at the border in 2013 were politically motivated and that it continues to use the border as a coercive tool against Gibraltar". It went on to say that border checks, "amount[ed] to a campaign of harassment and intimidation [...] [and] a pervasive feeling in Gibraltar of being under siege by a bullying and unreasonable power".
        p
          | The UK government mostly agreed with report and stated that tight border checks were "disproportionate, politically motivated, and therefore illegal."

        h2#as4 Referendum results

        h3 EU Referendum
        p
          | In the 2016 EU referendum, 96% of voters in Gibraltar (19,300) voted to remain, 4% (823) voted to leave. This proportion was the highest of any electoral district.

        h2#as5 Status after Brexit

        h3 Hard Brexit
        p
          | The pro-European campaign group, Open Britain, asserts that Gibraltar's economy is significantly reliant on EU rules of free movement of people due to the large proportion of its workforce commuting daily from Spain.
        p
          | After the referendum Fabian Picardo stated that a 'hard Brexit' was an 'existential threat' to the Gibraltarian economy. He later told the House of Commons Exiting the European Union Committee, however, that while access to the single market remained 'hugely important' to Gibraltar, the fact that 90% of its sales of financial, insurance and online gaming services with the UK, "steadied his nerves". Mr Picardo later stated "Gibraltar is enthusiastic and energetic about delivering a Brexit which we did not choose, but which we will make a success of".

        h3 Brexit and shared sovereignty
        p
          | The referendum result has renewed interest in the issue of Gibraltar's sovereignty. Former Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, JosÃ© GarcÃ­a Margallo said Brexit is a "unique opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back". The Government of Gibraltar responded strongly to the Minister's linking of Brexit with "his fantasy of sharing of the sovereignty of Gibraltar between the UK and Spain when one thing has clearly got nothing to do with the other".
        p
          | Fabian Picardo stated that shared sovereignty "would strip us of who we are" and that "it would be awful. Our home would be handed over to a party that has no claim to title". In evidence to the Exiting the European Union Committee he indicated the approach to take to the potential Spanish attempts to advance its claims:
        blockquote
          p
            | The less that the UK seeks in the context of the Article 50 negotiations, the harder it is for Spain to try and extract a price [...] It takes leverage away from those who might be trying to use those negotiations in some way to push the issue of Gibraltar.
          cite Quote by Peter Piper on 7th December 2017

        h3 UK response to issue of sovereignty and Brexit
        p
          | On 2 April 2017, following a discussion with Mr Picardo, Prime Minister Theresa May "reiterated our long-standing position that the UK remains steadfastly committed to our support of Gibraltar, its people and its economy". The press release from the discussion added:
        blockquote
          p
            | The Prime Minister said we will never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of another state against their freely and democratically expressed wishes, nor will we ever enter into a process of sovereignty negotiations with which Gibraltar is not content.
          cite Quote by Peter Piper on 7th December 2017
        p
          | In her meeting with Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, said that "the UK would seek the best possible deal for Gibraltar as the UK exits the EU and there would be no negotiations on the sovereignty of Gibraltar without the consent of its people"

        h3 Spanish view of sovereignty and Brexit
        p
          | Alfonso Dastis, current Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, is more conciliatory than his predecessor. His personal opinion is that "we won't put Gibraltar at the centre of negotiations. The situation is actually very clear and there is nothing for us to ask for. The UK leaves the EU and Gibraltar leaves the EU".
        p
          | He was, however, quoted as saying on TV "I am for 'Gibraltar espaÃ±ol'" by the Gibraltarian press. He has also said that Spain has to "be intelligent when it comes to tackling this issue".

        h3 Reaction to draft Brexit negotiation guidelines
        p
          | Gibraltar is specifically mentioned in paragraph 22 of the European Council's draft Brexit negotiation guidelines released on 31 March 2017:
        blockquote
          p
            | After the United Kingdom leaves the Union, no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom.
          cite Quote by Peter Piper on 7th December 2017
        p
          | Some commentators believe this to mean that a Brexit deal will not automatically apply to Gibraltar. That Spain will be given veto over the inclusion of Gibraltar in Brexit without additional Anglo-Spanish bilateral deal with the territory.
        p
          | In response to the clause, the Government of Gibraltar stated that [it] "has shamefully been singled out [...] for unfavourable treatment by the Council, at the behest of Spain".
        p
          | Andrew Rosindell, Conservative MP for Romford and vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Gibraltar, said that "an agreement without including Gibraltar means there can be no agreement". He added, "any agreement must apply equally to the whole British family and that includes Gibraltar. There can be no compromise on this".
        p
          | Alfonso Dastis said the clause was "no reason" for the UK to "lose their nerve".
        p
          | Some commentators believe the inclusion to be of little importance as all EU governments have the power to veto any agreement with the UK. It does show, however, clear EU political loyalty to Spain. A senior EU official confirmed this, "the Union will stick up for its members, and that means Spain now".
