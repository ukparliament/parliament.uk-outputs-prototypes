          h2 Overview
          P UK airspace is a network of corridors or airways. It is the volume of space above ground level that extends as far as planes can fly. It is either &lsquo;controlled&rsquo; or &lsquo;uncontrolled&rsquo;. Air Traffic Control (ATC) manages aircraft in controlled airspace through a system of structured routes. Uncontrolled airspace is not managed from the ground. Planes have to &ldquo;see and avoid&rdquo; other aircraft and navigate on their own.
          p Three organisations have responsibility for UK airspace. The Department of Transport manages aviation policy. It creates airspace laws and policy within international and European standards and requirements. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is the UK&rsquo;s aviation regulator. It plans and regulates all UK airspace. National Air Traffic Services (NATS) provides en-route air traffic services to planes flying in UK airspace.
          p The UK is a member of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Members of the ICAO agree regulations and international standards on a range of issues including access and use of airspace. EU laws put in place several of ICAO&rsquo;s resolutions. The EU&rsquo;s main initiative, the Single European Sky (SES) was launched in 1999. Its aim was to reform the European air traffic management and increase the efficiency of the European air transport system.

            figcaption An example of an air traffic control tower at London Heathrow.
          p The UK and Ireland are working together to meet SES requirements through its Future Airspace Strategy. Published in 2011, the strategy aims to modernise UK airspace by 2030. The biggest changes are likely to come in the south east of England where 5 airports and many aerodromes create much of the world&rsquo;s air traffic.
          p In February 2017 the DoT published a consultation on UK airspace policy reform. In October the government said it would proceed with most of the proposals in the paper. This included proposals for an Independent Commission on Civil Aviation Noise which would:
          ul
            li provide ways for industry to assess noise
            li help industry manage change by providing best route options
            li bring compensation for airspace changes in line with changes to aviation infrastructure
          p New Air Navigation Guidance took effect from 1 January 2018. The new airspace change process began on 2 January under #[+link('https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP1616%2520Airspace%2520Design%2520interactive.pdf#page%253D141', 'CAP 1616')].

          h2 What is airspace?
          p Airspace is the volume of space above ground level. It extends as far as planes can fly. UK airspace contains a network of corridors, or airways. These are usually ten miles wide and reach up to a height of 24,000 feet from a base of between 5,000 and 7,000 feet. Controlled airspace can go from ground level to 66,000 feet in some cases, and &apos;air routes&apos; can have bases down to 3,500 feet.
          p In the UK airspace is either considered to be &lsquo;controlled&rsquo; or &lsquo;uncontrolled&rsquo;. Air Traffic Control (ATC) manage air traffic control services. They oversee the airspace and track the separation of aircraft to keep them safe as they head towards their destinations.
          p A large volume of airspace in the UK is uncontrolled. This is where the pilot of the aircraft does not receive a service from the ground. The pilot has to &ldquo;see and avoid&rdquo; other aircraft and navigate independently. Most light aircraft and some military and commercial aircraft operate in this airspace. Arrangements for UK airspace follow internationally agreed safety and operational practices and requirements.

              span [1]

          h3#flight-paths Flight Paths
          p Within controlled airspace commercial aircraft fly within permanent airspace structures. These are set out in the UK Integrated Aeronautical Information Package (IAIP). They include departure and arrival routes.
          p A flight path is the actual or planned course of an aircraft. The government&rsquo;s February 2017 consultation explains how aircraft follow flight paths over the course of a journey:
          blockquote
            p After take-off from the runway, aircraft will typically follow a pre- defined route up to a given altitude above ground level (usually 4,000 feet). The route is determined by the Standard Instrument Departure procedure (SID). This is a programme on the aircraft&rsquo;s computer system. Next, the aircraft will be directed or &lsquo;vectored&rsquo;
            p &mldr; by air traffic controllers until they reach an airway. Airways are high-altitude routes which aircraft follow to their eventual destination.
            p During landing, aircraft leave their airway and enter a Standard Arrival Route (STAR). They may be &lsquo;held&rsquo; in a stack until it is safe to bring them in for landing. Once it is safe, the aircraft are vectored with the assistance of air traffic control to safely approach the runway. For safety reasons, this closing stage requires aircraft to fly in a very straight line on their final approach. An Instrumental Landing System (&lsquo;ILS&rsquo;), is often used to assist with this. It helps pilots to line up with the runway by providing vertical and horizontal guidance, even when they cannot physically see the runway.
              a#ref2(href='#fn2', aria-label='reference 2')
                span [2]
          p Air traffic controllers direct aircraft by way of &lsquo;vectoring&rsquo;. This is the practice of giving a pilot a &apos;heading&apos;. This is a direction to travel towards, as a step on the way to a destination. Controllers give headings depending on a number of factors.
          p The headings depend to some extent on individual circumstances. They are mainly determined by location. Also by non-location specific Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) standard procedures.

            li the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). It has set a common regulatory framework and international standards on various issues. These include the access to and use of airspace.
            li Eurocontrol is the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation. It is an intergovernmental organisation with 41 Member and 2 Comprehensive Agreement States. Its primary goal is the development of a pan-European ATM system.
            li The EU Common Transport Policy governs air traffic management. Set up in 2004 it lays down common rules for international transport coming to and from, as well as passing through, countries in EU member states. The European Commission leads on Single European Sky initiative. It aims to create a coordinated European air traffic management system.

            p My Department ran a call for evidence last year to explore the options for the future of the Government&rsquo;s 49% shareholding in the UK&rsquo;s air traffic control provider, NATS Holdings plc (NATS).
            p The responses, along with work done by my officials in conjunction with other stakeholders, highlighted the strategic importance of NATS to the UK and the far-reaching implications of a sale at this time. These include the continued development of the single European sky agenda and the ongoing work on the single European sky air traffic management research programme (SESAR).
            p In parallel, I have considered the potential value that could be realised through a sale of the shares alongside the benefits from receiving dividends from a retained shareholding.
            p After considering these factors, I have concluded that it is in the best interests of the British taxpayer, the travelling public and the company itself to retain the Government&rsquo;s shares in NATS at this time.

          p In the past Airspace over Europe developed around state geographic borders and boundaries. This led to it being fragmented. The Transport Select Committee explained in a 2009 report:
          blockquote
            p International flights currently have to pass through national air traffic zones or &ldquo;blocks&rdquo;, before being handed over from one national authority to another. For example, passenger aircraft travelling between Brussels and Rome must pass through nine different air traffic control zones. This system leads to bottlenecks and delays, forcing aircraft to consume more fuel and jeopardising safety. As a consequence, flights in Europe are on average 49 kilometres longer than needed. The European Commission estimates that the fragmentation of Europe&apos;s airspace costs &euro;1 billion each year and that shorter, direct routes could save five million tonnes of CO&#x2082; annually.

          h2 Planning airspace change
          p Airspace change &ndash; whether temporary or permanent &ndash; can have unwelcome impacts for local communities. There have been concerns about airports consulting those affected by change. Or that the change process itself has not been properly explained.
          p Changes to airspace design occur for varying reasons. Improvements to flight efficiency, to reduce delays or to allow an increase in flights due to airport expansion. Airspace changes can be modest. Amendments to upper airspace routes, for example, that affect only a small number of stakeholders. Or they can be major. Such as changes in low-level airspace that impact a large number of people. Formal airspace changes occur via the CAA but may be planned ahead of a new development.
          p If new airspace arrangements are needed, the planning process can serve as a precursor to the airspace change process. Final decisions on the structure of the UK&rsquo;s airspace and detailed route design go through the CAA&rsquo;s Airspace Change Process. The planning process can consider indicative routes and their potential impacts.
